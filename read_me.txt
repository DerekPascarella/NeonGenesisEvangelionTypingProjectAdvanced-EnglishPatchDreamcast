.-----------::[ Patching Instructions ]::-----------
|
| Unfortunately, this release could not come in the form of a standard patch
| using my Universal Dreamcast Patcher tool.  This is because the GDIs and even
| Redump-style CUEs for this game have some sort of issue that prevents their
| successful extraction via gditools.  Therefore, I have opted to publish the
| fully-patched GDI and CDI for all to enjoy.

.------------::[ v1.0 Release Notes ]::-------------
|
| For all 15 of you out there who appreciated my English translation patch of 
| the other "Neon Genesis Evangelion" typing game for Dreamcast, I’m proud to 
| present to you the next installment in the series: Neon Genesis Evangelion - 
| Typing Project Advanced!  It really must be true what they say... The 
| Dream™ never dies.
|
| In this initial release (which likely also be the only release), all menus, 
| options, dialog boxes, and screens have been fully translated.  Most cases of 
| important spoken dialog have been subtitled where possible, but due to 
| technical limitations I was not able to achieve this everywhere.  
| Furthermore, all levels are fully playable in English thanks to the clever 
| hack I worked out for the first game.
|
| For those curious as to how that works, or for those wondering why the font 
| of typed words in-game seems a bit off, please refer back to the release 
| notes for v2.0 of my English translation patch for "Typing Project E":

|
| Moving on, the "WEBPAGE" option on the title screen takes you to a browser 
| that displays a website that's stored directly on the disc.  All of that 
| page’s links are dead, though.  The sparse findings on archive.org were not 
| compelling enough to warrant a translation.  I considered including a fully 
| unlocked save within the browser like I did for "Sakura Wars: Columns 2", but 
| ultimately decided against it.  "Columns" was a far bigger and more difficult 
| game to fully unlock, yet I still wanted fans to be able to experience all of 
| its amazing content.  "Typing Project Advanced" is a different story.
|
| A hidden level (Level 7) is unlocked after levels 1 through 6 are cleared 
| with decent enough scores (i.e. minimal typos).  If you can manage a perfect 
| score on every level (i.e. no typos), then a "BONUS" entry will be added to 
| the title screen.  This option is actually the dancing stage from "Typing 
| Project E", so nothing too exciting there for those who played the first game.
|
| The last thing to note is the presence of certain keyboard-input options in a 
| couple areas of the game that clearly state something to the effect of 
| "English Translation Mode" and "Non-Working Original Mode".  Quite obvious, I 
| know.  However, I wanted to make mention here in the release notes that using 
| the non-working mode will, of course, not work!
|
| All of that being said, I hope those reading these release notes and playing 
| this game are happy to have another excuse to bust out their Dreamcast 
| keyboards.  In closing, I want to thank all of the wonderful people in the 
| Dreamcast scene for their awesome passion for SEGA’s swan song console.  
| The Dreamcast has always been, and always will be, a huge part of my life.  
| Yet, without the fans, none of that would be possible.  Keep Dreaming™, my 
| friends...
